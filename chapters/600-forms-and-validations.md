#### Online Shop:

> Add a new "Edit" button on the detail page. Pressing it should open a new view, which uses reactive forms to update the properties of the product. The view should have two buttons: "Cancel" (which undos all the changes) and "Save" (which calls the backend to persist the changes).
>
> Add some validation to your form (ex: check that the fields are not empty, that the price and weight inputs contain only numbers, etc.)
>
> Also create a new "Add" button on the product list. Pressing this button should open a view for creating a new product (which the same structure and buttons as the edit view).
