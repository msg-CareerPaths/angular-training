# 4. Angular Intro [4h]

**Goal:** become familiar with Angular.

## Important Note

A very important notion to keep in mind is to always format your code from this moment forward. Both [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting) and [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html) have this option in them.
Therefore, after saving/editing your file try to make it an ingrained action for you. This is important in team-based codespaces where you will get conflicts by creating unnecessary changes by not formatting.
