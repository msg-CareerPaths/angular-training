#### Required:

*Videos*

#### Online Shop:

> Add a button next to each product from the product list. You can use it to navigate to a specific product's detail page.
>
> From the detail page of the product, the user may add it to his shopping cart (by pressing a button).
>
> Add Routing to your project and implement a navigation between the list of all products and the product detail page. Use [`<router-outlet>`](https://angular.io/guide/router#router-outlet) as a placeholder for the currently displayed component in your app.
>
> Add a navigation which redirects users from the default path ('/') to the '/products' page and displays by default the list of all products.
>
> Enhance your app with routing parameters, such that you can navigate to a specific product's detail page. Hint: Use [`snapshot`](https://angular.io/guide/router#snapshot-the-no-observable-alternative) to capture the product's ID as a navigation parameter and display it in the details page.
