# 11. Simple NgRx [8h]

**Goal:** Use NgRx for state management.

**Note:** Communicate with your mentor about this step, do no get stuck and try to do everything by yourself.

**Note:** Redux is usually used for medium to large scale projects, we will use it here for you to get an understanding of its fundamentals.

    - Take note to use the latest variants of creating actions, selectors, reducers and effects as per documentation:
        - Actions: `export const increment = createAction('[Counter Component] Increment');`
        - Reducers:
      ```
        export const counterReducer = createReducer(
          initialState,
          on(increment, (state) => state + 1),
          on(decrement, (state) => state - 1),
          on(reset, (state) => 0)
        );
       ```
        - Selectors:
       ```
        export const selectFeature = (state: AppState) => state.feature;
  
        export const selectFeatureCount = createSelector(
          selectFeature,
          (state: FeatureState) => state.counter
        );
       ```

## Online Shop:

> Add NGRX to your app by:
>  - Creating a reducer for your application. It should contain information about the products and the user
>  - Adding actions for each user input handler, data load event, etc.
>  - Adding effects to react on the data loading actions and call the services,
>  - Dispatching the actions and selecting the state **only** inside the smart components.
>
> Hints:
>  - Make sure to also have a loading flag indicator in each page's state,
>  - Use the async pipe inside the smart components to not pass `Observables` to dumb components,
>  - Install the [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) Chrome plugin to be able to debug your store.
>  - Also add the [Ngrx Store DevTools](https://ngrx.io/guide/store-devtools/install) to your application for it to work.
### Folder Structure

**Note**: The structure presented is for a brief understanding, the best practice will be to have a `state` folder per module.

```text
├── src/app
│   ├── app.state.ts
│   ├── modules
│       ├── shared
│           ├── state
│               ├── app.reducers.ts -- aggregates reducer, intialState and selectors. It has one reducer for user, products and shopping cart
│               ├── app.actions.ts
│               ├── app.effects.ts
│.......<the previous files>................................
```
